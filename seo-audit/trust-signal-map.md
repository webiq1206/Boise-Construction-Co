## Competitor trust benchmark (see competitor-gap-analysis.md)

Treasure Valley leaders publish strong trust signals BRC currently lacks:
- **Strite Design + Remodel:** NARI Remodeler of the Year, Remodeling Top 500, 114+ reviews, named since 1975.
- **Renaissance Remodeling:** NARI-certified, named owners (Chad & Shelley), since 1997, 5.0 Houzz.
- **Apex Home Solutions:** "Idaho's Best Remodeler 2020 & 2021," named owners (John & Theresa), showroom.
- **Boyd:** 3-year warranty, Best of Houzz, since 2004.

## Recommendations (priority)

1. **Publish real reviews + aggregate rating** (data-gated) → unlocks star rich results. Plumbing is ready.
2. **Add GBP URL + Houzz/Yelp to `sameAs`** (data-gated).
3. **Name 1–2 credentialed people** (founder + lead designer/PM) with bios → biggest E-E-A-T lift.
4. **Publish contractor license number** in footer + schema.
5. **Pursue/claim NARI Idaho membership** and surface it (associations are a clear competitor advantage).
