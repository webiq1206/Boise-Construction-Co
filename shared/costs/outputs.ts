/**
 * The two views of an estimate, and the wall between them.
 *
 * A LEAD sees: the planning range, a summary of what they told us, and the
 * disclaimers. Nothing else. No unit costs, no line items, no trade totals, no
 * margin, no markup, no contingency figure, no internal cost. The range and the
 * summary are the entire customer-facing surface, on the website and in the
 * confirmation email alike.
 *
 * An ADMIN sees: parent trades with the quantity that drove them, internal cost,
 * the margin actually applied, the customer-facing amount, and any warnings.
 * Child line items are computed and retained for audit but collapsed by default,
 * because a forty-line takeoff is not a briefing.
 *
 * The wall is enforced by construction rather than by discipline: buildLeadView
 * cannot reach a cost, because it is never handed one. It takes the range and
 * the selections and nothing else.
