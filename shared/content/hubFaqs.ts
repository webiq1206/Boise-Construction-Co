        answer:
          'Most full kitchen remodels in the Treasure Valley plan between roughly $45,000 and $120,000+ depending on layout changes, cabinetry line, and finishes. Guest-scale refreshes cost less; open-concept structural work costs more.',

        question: 'How long does a kitchen remodel take?',
        answer:
          'Expect 4–10 weeks for design and selections, 2–8 weeks for permits when layout changes, and 8–16 weeks of construction. Cabinet lead times often drive the calendar.',

        question: 'Do I need permits for a kitchen remodel in Ada County?',
        answer:

        question: 'Do bathroom remodels need permits in the Treasure Valley?',

        question: 'How long does a master bath remodel take?',

        question: 'Should guest and master baths share one budget?',
