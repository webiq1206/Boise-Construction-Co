  {
    question: 'How much does a typical home remodel cost in Boise?',
    answer:
      'Most homeowners should plan room-level budgets: kitchens often $45,000–$120,000+, master baths $35,000–$85,000+, and whole-home programs $150,000–$400,000+ depending on scope and finishes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are remodeling costs higher in Eagle than in Meridian?',
    answer:
      'Finish level and structural complexity drive price more than zip code alone. Eagle projects often include premium materials and HOA design review time, which can increase overall investment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you include permits in remodeling quotes?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Boise Remodeling Co includes permits in design-build scope for Ada and Canyon County projects and coordinates submissions on your behalf.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do remodeling bids vary so much?',
    answer:
      'Bids differ when scope, allowances, permit fees, and finish levels are not aligned. A lower bid may exclude demolition haul-off, design, or engineering.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I budget contingency for a remodel?',
    answer:
      'Hold 10–15% contingency for concealed conditions - especially in pre-1990 Boise and Bench homes where framing, plumbing, or wiring surprises are common.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are appliances included in kitchen remodel cost?',
    answer:
      'Appliances are typically client-supplied. We guide selection and coordinate rough-in but do not purchase or install appliances.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a kitchen remodel take in the Treasure Valley?',
    answer:
      'Many full kitchen remodels run 8–16 weeks of construction after design and permits. Cabinet lead times can add weeks before demo.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What permits are needed for a bathroom remodel in Boise?',
    answer:
      'Cosmetic updates may need minimal permits. Layout changes, plumbing relocations, and structural work require Ada County or city plan review with inspections.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is cost per square foot accurate for remodeling?',
    answer:
      'Cost per square foot is a planning shorthand for whole-home or addition work. Individual rooms like kitchens should be budgeted on room scope, not whole-house SF alone.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does design-build affect total cost?',
    answer:
      'Design-build consolidates design, estimating, and construction under one contract, reducing change orders and gaps common when design and build are separate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the cheapest remodel with the best ROI?',
    answer:
      'Focused bath and kitchen updates often deliver strong lifestyle and resale value when aligned with neighborhood comps - avoid over-improving beyond the street.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I remodel in phases to spread cost?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Phasing can spread cash flow but may add mobilization cost. A master plan helps keep finishes cohesive across phases.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Canyon County remodels cost less than Ada County?',
    answer:
      'Labor and materials are similar; differences are usually permit processes, travel, and project scope - not a simple county discount.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get a realistic remodeling number for my home?',
    answer:
      'Start with our online estimator for a planning range, then schedule an in-home consultation for a written scope tied to your layout and selections.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Boise Remodeling Co publish starting-at prices?',
    answer:
      'We publish planning ranges by project type for education, not bait pricing. Firm numbers require seeing your home and defining scope.',
  },
