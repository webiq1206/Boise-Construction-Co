## Recurring cadence

- **Weekly**: 1 GBP post (city-tagged, deep-links a guide); review ask on every completed project
- **Monthly**: AI-engine spot checks ("best remodeling contractor Boise/Meridian", "kitchen remodel cost Boise") - log brand mentions and cited URLs; update `rating/reviewCount`; 2-4 new GBP photos
- **Quarterly**: re-run `scripts/audit-url-data.ts` + `audit-url-matrix.ts` to refresh the URL matrix; cost-content refresh (`updatedAt` bumps); citation sweep: search `"Boise Remodeling Co" -site:boiseremodeling.co` and the old phone `(208) 405-8425` (should return nothing)

## KPIs (6-month targets)

- GBP: verified, 25+ reviews, all 5 service categories live
- Zero live citations with the old phone/Lake Fork address
- Local Pack appearances for "remodeling contractor meridian" and "kitchen remodel boise" (tracked manually or via grid tool)
- At least one AI-engine citation of boiseremodeling.co for a cost query
- All 8 hub pillars at 800+ words; 0 content pages under 150 words
